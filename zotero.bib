	abstract = {Alcohol dehydrogenase 5 (ADH5) is a member of the mammalian alcohol dehydrogenase family of yet undefined functions. ADH5 was first identified at the DNA level in human and deer mouse. A rat alcohol dehydrogenase structure of similar type has been isolated at the cDNA level using human ADH5 as a screening probe, where the rat cDNA structure displayed several atypical properties. mRNA for rat ADH5 was found in multiple tissues, especially in the kidney. In vitro translation experiments indicated that rat ADH5 is expressed as efficiently as ADH1 and furthermore, rat ADH5 was readily expressed in COS cells fused to Green Fluorescent Protein. However, no soluble ADH5 protein could be heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli cells with expression systems successfully used for other mammalian ADHs, including fused to glutathione-S-transferase. Molecular modelling of the enzyme indicated that the protein does not fold in a productive way, which can be the explanation why no stable and active ADH5 has been isolated. These results indicate that ADH5, while readily expressed at the mRNA level, does not behave similarly to other mammalian ADHs investigated. The results, in vitro and in silico, suggest an unstable ADH5 structure, which can explain for why no active and stable protein can be isolated. Further possibilities are conceivable: the ADH5 protein may have to interact with a stabiliser, or the gene is actually a pseudogene.},

	abstract = {Multiple sequence alignment is one of the cornerstones of modern molecular biology. It is used to identify conserved motifs, to determine protein domains, in 2D/3D structure prediction by homology and in evolutionary studies. Recently, high-throughput technologies such as genome sequencing and structural proteomics have lead to an explosion in the amount of sequence and structure information available. In response, several new multiple alignment methods have been developed that improve both the efficiency and the quality of protein alignments. Consequently, the benchmarks used to evaluate and compare these methods must also evolve. We present here the latest release of the most widely used multiple alignment benchmark, BAliBASE, which provides high quality, manually refined, reference alignments based on 3D structural superpositions. Version 3.0 of BAliBASE includes new, more challenging test cases, representing the real problems encountered when aligning large sets of complex sequences. Using a novel, semiautomatic update protocol, the number of protein families in the benchmark has been increased and representative test cases are now available that cover most of the protein fold space. The total number of proteins in BAliBASE has also been significantly increased from 1444 to 6255 sequences. In addition, full-length sequences are now provided for all test cases, which represent difficult cases for both global and local alignment programs. Finally, the BAliBASE Web site (http://www-bio3d-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/balibase) has been completely redesigned to provide a more user-friendly, interactive interface for the visualization of the BAliBASE reference alignments and the associated annotations.},

An introductory summary of these stages is given, followed by a current update on the now known structures, including the present pattern of mammalian MDR–ADH enzymes into six classes and their evolutionary relationships. In spite of the wide spread in evolutionary changes from the “constant” class III to the more “variable” other classes, the change in class V (only confirmed as a transcript in humans) and class VI (absent in humans) are also restricted. Such spread in variability is visible also in other dehydrogenases, but not always so restricted in other co-evolving proteins we have studied. Finally, the shift in era of present ADH research is highlighted, as well as levels of likely future continuation.},

Transcripts of multiple length were detected for most classes and were due to different gene products arising through the use of different poly-A signals or transcription from different gene loci. Both class II and class V showed a pattern of liver-enriched expression. However, low mRNA levels were detected also in stomach, pancreas and small intestine for class II, and in fetal kidney and small intestine for class V. Significantly higher levels of class V transcripts were present in fetal liver when compared with levels in adult liver, which suggests that human class V is a predominantly fetal alcohol dehydrogenase.},

	abstract = {We describe a comparative protein modelling method designed to find the most probable structure for a sequence given its alignment with related structures. The three-dimensional (3D) model is obtained by optimally satisfying spatial restraints derived from the alignment and expressed as probability density functions (pdfs) for the features restrained. For example, the probabilities for main-chain conformations of a modelled residue may be restrained by its residue type, main-chain conformation of an equivalent residue in a related protein, and the local similarity between the two sequences. Several such pdfs are obtained from the correlations between structural features in 17 families of homologous proteins which have been aligned on the basis of their 3D structures. The pdfs restrain C alpha-C alpha distances, main-chain N-O distances, main-chain and side-chain dihedral angles. A smoothing procedure is used in the derivation of these relationships to minimize the problem of a sparse database. The 3D model of a protein is obtained by optimization of the molecular pdf such that the model violates the input restraints as little as possible. The molecular pdf is derived as a combination of pdfs restraining individual spatial features of the whole molecule. The optimization procedure is a variable target function method that applies the conjugate gradients algorithm to positions of all non-hydrogen atoms. The method is automated and is illustrated by the modelling of trypsin from two other serine proteinases.},

With the increasing amount of available genomic data a general pattern is possible to trace within the mammalian ADH gene and protein families. The transcriptional order for the ADH genes in all mammalian genomes is the same (ADH4–ADH1–ADH6–ADH5–ADH2–ADH3), but the cluster is found on different chromosomes in different species. However, in primates only ADH1–ADH5 are present, where the loss of ADH6 may have occurred simultaneously as the split into ADH1 isoforms. ADH3, also denoted glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase and S-nitrosoglutathione reductase, is identified as the last gene in the ADH transcriptional order, but several pseudogenes for ADH3 have been traced at other chromosomes. The flanking genes outside the ADH genome are similar or identical for all species showing that a larger DNA region has been duplicated and further evolved. However, the only entirely completed ADH genomes are those from primates and rodents.

The latest identified ADH forms, ADH5 (class V) and ADH6 (class VI), are truly different classes and both are very diverged in contrast to ADH3, which is the most conserved class of all ADHs. ADH5 and ADH6 have been identified at the gene and transcriptional levels only, and their functions are still an enigma.},

Deduced amino acid sequences show that isozymic forms of rabbit class II alcohol dehydrogenase exist, with a positional identity of 88.4 \%. A high variability in structure of class II alcohol dehydrogenase between the species is also reflected in function. The rabbit II-1 isozyme shows common characteristics with the human enzyme, but has a lower Km value for ethanol, 4.2 mM. The II-2 isozyme shows restriction for aliphatic alcohols longer than pentanol. For shorter alcohols the II-2 form has similar Km values as the II-1 isozyme, 5.5 mM for ethanol, but is a low activity variant with a 10-fold decrease in kcat values compared with II-1. Nevertheless, II-2 has a higher specificity for benzoquinone than II-1 due to a lower Km value, 80 μM compared with 1 mM, and is in this sense more like the human class II enzyme. In addition a rabbit class III alcohol dehydrogenase cDNA was isolated that encodes a typical class III enzyme/glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase. The finding of isozymic forms of class II alcohol dehydrogenase is in line with the evolution of the system of medium-chain alcohol dehydrogenases with different enzymes, different classes and different isozymes and further underline the complexity of the entire mammalian alcohol dehydrogenase system.},

	abstract = {Analysis of the activity and structure of lower vertebrate alcohol dehydrogenases reveals that relationships between the classical liver and yeast enzymes need not be continuous. Both the ethanol activity of class I-type alcohol dehydrogenase (alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.1) and the glutathione-dependent formaldehyde activity of the class III-type enzyme [formaldehyde:NAD+ oxidoreductase (glutathione-formylating), EC 1.2.1.1] are present in liver down to at least the stage of bony fishes (cod liver: ethanol activity, 3.4 units/mg of protein in one enzyme; formaldehyde activity, 4.5 units/mg in the major form of another enzyme). Structural analysis of the latter protein reveals it to be a typical class III enzyme, with limited variation from the mammalian form and therefore with stable activity and structure throughout much of the vertebrate lineage. In contrast, the classical alcohol dehydrogenase (the class I enzyme) appears to be the emerging form, first in activity and later also in structure. The class I activity is present already in the piscine line, whereas the overall structural-type enzyme is not observed until amphibians and still more recent vertebrates. Consequently, the class I/III duplicatory origin appears to have arisen from a functional class III form, not a class I form. Therefore, ethanol dehydrogenases from organisms existing before this duplication have origins separate from those leading to the "classical" liver alcohol dehydrogenases. The latter now often occur in isozyme forms from further gene duplications and have a high rate of evolutionary change. The pattern is, however, not simple and we presently find in cod the first evidence for isozymes also within a class III alcohol dehydrogenase. Overall, the results indicate that both of these classes of vertebrate alcohol dehydrogenase are important and suggest a protective metabolic function for the whole enzyme system.},

	abstract = {This work explores the impact of knots, knot depth and motif of the threading terminus in protein folding properties (kinetics, thermodynamics and mechanism) via extensive Monte Carlo simulations of lattice models. A knotted backbone has no effect on protein thermodynamic stability but it may affect key aspects of folding kinetics. In this regard, we found clear evidence for a functional advantage of knots: knots enhance kinetic stability because a knotted protein unfolds at a distinctively slower rate than its unknotted counterpart. However, an increase in knot deepness does not necessarily lead to more effective changes in folding properties. In this regard, a terminus with a non-trivial conformation (e.g. hairpin) can have a more dramatic effect in enhancing kinetic stability than knot depth. Nevertheless, our results suggest that the probability of the denatured ensemble to keep knotted is higher for proteins with deeper knots, indicating that knot depth plays a role in determining the topology of the denatured state. Refolding simulations starting from denatured knotted conformations show that not every knot is able to nucleate folding and further indicate that the formation of the knotting loop is a key event in the folding of knotted trefoils. They also show that there are specific native contacts within the knotted core that are crucial to keep a native knotting loop in denatured conformations which otherwise have no detectable structure. The study of the knotting mechanism reveals that the threading of the knotting loop generally occurs towards late folding in conformations that exhibit a significant degree of structural consolidation.},

Selective inhibition of PTGR2 may contribute to the improvement of insulin sensitivity with fewer side effects. PTGR2 belongs to the medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. The crystal structures reported here reveal features of the NADPH binding-induced conformational change in a LID motif and a polyproline type II helix which are critical for the reaction. Mutation of Tyr64 and Tyr259 significantly reduces the rate of catalysis but increases the affinity to substrate, confirming the structural observations. Besides targeting cyclooxygenase, indomethacin also inhibits PTGR2 with a binding mode similar to that of 15-keto-PGE(2). The LID motif becomes highly disordered upon the binding of indomethacin, indicating plasticity of the active site. This study has implications for the rational design of inhibitors of PTGR2.},

They use (i) large sets of multiple aligned sequences and (ii) assume that correlations between columns in these alignments can be the results of indirect interaction. These methods are clearly superior to earlier methods when it comes to predicting contacts in proteins. Here, we demonstrate that combining predictions from two prediction methods, PSICOV and plmDCA, and two alignment methods, HHblits and jackhmmer at four different e-value cut-offs, provides a relative improvement of 20\% in comparison with the best single method, exceeding 70\% correct predictions for one contact prediction per residue.

To differentiate the physiological roles of ADH1 and ADH4 in retinoid metabolism we report here the generation of an Adh1/4 double null mutant mouse and its comparison to single null mutants. We demonstrate that loss of both ADH1 and ADH4 does not have additive effects, either for production of retinoic acid needed for development or for retinol turnover to minimize toxicity. During gestational vitamin A deficiency Adh4 and Adh1/4 mutants exhibit completely penetrant postnatal lethality by day 15 and day 24, respectively, while 60\% of Adh1 mutants survive to adulthood similar to wild-type. Following administration of a 50-mg/kg dose of retinol to examine retinol turnover, Adh1 and Adh1/4 mutants exhibit similar 10-fold decreases in retinoic acid production, whereas Adh4 mutants have only a slight decrease. LD(50) studies indicate a large increase in acute retinol toxicity for Adh1 mutants, a small increase for Adh4 mutants, and an intermediate increase for Adh1/4 mutants. Chronic retinol supplementation during gestation resulted in 65\% postnatal lethality in Adh1 mutants, whereas only approximately 5\% for Adh1/4 and Adh4 mutants. These studies indicate that ADH1 provides considerable protection against vitamin A toxicity, whereas ADH4 promotes survival during vitamin A deficiency, thus demonstrating largely non-overlapping functions for these enzymes in retinoid metabolism.},

Expression of HsNrbf-1, tagged C-terminally with green fluorescent protein, in HeLa cells, resulted in a punctated fluorescence signal, superimposable with the MitoTracker Red dye. Wild-type polypeptide was immunoisolated from the extract of bovine heart mitochondria. Recombinant HsNrbf-1p reduces trans-2-enoyl-CoA to acyl-CoA with chain length from C6 to C16 in an NADPH-dependent manner with preference to medium chain length substrate. Furthermore, expression of HsNRBF-1 in the ybr026cDelta yeast strain restored mitochondrial respiratory function allowing growth on glycerol. These findings provide evidence that Nrbf-1ps act as a mitochondrial 2-enoyl thioester reductase, and mammalian cells may possess bacterial type fatty acid synthetase (FAS type II) in mitochondria, in addition to FAS type I in the cytoplasm.},

	abstract = {Different short-chain dehydrogenases are distantly related, constituting a protein family now known from at least 20 separate enzymes characterized, but with extensive differences, especially in the C-terminal third of their sequences. Many of the first known members were prokaryotic, but recent additions include mammalian enzymes from placenta, liver and other tissues, including 15-hydroxyprostaglandin, 17 beta-hydroxysteroid and 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases. In addition, species variants, isozyme-like multiplicities and mutants have been reported for several of the structures. Alignments of the different enzymes reveal large homologous parts, with clustered similarities indicating regions of special functional/structural importance. Several of these derive from relationships within a common type of coenzyme-binding domain, but central-chain patterns of similarity go beyond this domain. Total residue identities between enzyme pairs are typically around 25\%, but single forms deviate more or less (14-58\%). Only six of the 250-odd residues are strictly conserved and seven more are conserved in all but single cases. Over one third of the conserved residues are glycine, showing the importance of conformational and spatial restrictions. Secondary structure predictions, residue distributions and hydrophilicity profiles outline a common, N-terminal coenzyme-binding domain similar to that of other dehydrogenases, and a C-terminal domain with unique segments and presumably individual functions in each case. Strictly conserved residues of possible functional interest are limited, essentially only three polar residues. Asp64, Tyr152 and Lys156 (in the numbering of Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase), but no histidine or cysteine residue like in the completely different, classical medium-chain alcohol dehydrogenase family. Asp64 is in the suggested coenzyme-binding domain, whereas Tyr152 and Lys156 are close to the center of the protein chain, at a putative inter-domain, active-site segment. Consequently, the overall comparisons suggest the possibility of related mechanisms and domain properties for different members of the short-chain family.},

As an example, we characterized a $\beta$-strand–helix interaction from the FAD or NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold. The Rossmann fold is one of the three most highly represented folds in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). A subset of the proteins that adopt the Rossmann fold also bind to nucleotide cofactors such as FAD and NAD(P) and function as oxidoreductases. These Rossmann folds can often be identified by the short amino acid sequence motif, GX1–2GXXG. Here, we present evidence that in addition to this sequence motif, Rossmann folds that bind FAD and NAD(P) also typically contain either GXXXG or GXXXA motifs, where the first glycyl residue of these motifs and the third glycyl residue of the GX1–2GXXG motif are the same residue. These two motifs appear to stabilize the Rossmann fold: the first glycyl residue of either the GXXXG or GXXXA motif contacts the carbonyl oxygen atom from the first glycyl residue of the GX1–2GXXG motif consistent with the formation of a C$\alpha$–H⋯O hydrogen bond. In addition, both the glycyl and alanyl residues of the GXXXG or GXXXA motifs form van der Waals interactions with either a valine or isoleucine residue located either seven or eight residues further back along the polypeptide chain from the first glycine of the GXXXG or GXXXA motifs. Therefore, we combine both the GX1–2GXXG and GXXXG/A motifs into an extended motif, V/IXGX1–2GXXGXXXG/A, that is more strongly indicative than previously described motifs of Rossmann folds that bind FAD or NAD(P). The V/IXGX1–2GXXGXXXG/A motif can be used to search genomic sequence data and to annotate the function of proteins containing the motif as oxidoreductases, including proteins of previously unknown function.},

To develop a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for regenerative failure we used a yeast two-hybrid approach to try and identify proteins that interact with Nogo. We identified a novel mitochondrial protein designated Nogo-interacting mitochondrial protein (NIMP) in a screen of an adult human brain cDNA library. This interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation in both brain tissue (endogenous) and transfected HEK293T cells (overexpressed). In support of these studies we demonstrate that Nogo interacts with the UQCRC1 and UQCRC2 components of complex III, within the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The mitochondrial localization of NIMP was evidenced by confocal image analysis and western blot analysis of isolated mitochondria. NIMP is highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed in mitochondria-enriched tissues. Within the CNS, NIMP-like immunoreactivity is present in neurons and astrocytes. These data suggest that NIMP is a novel mitochondrial protein that interacts with Nogo. The interaction of Nogo with mitochondrial proteins may provide insight into the mechanisms for Nogo-induced inhibition of neurite growth.},

It was deduced from a careful analysis of the known three-dimensional structures of ADP-binding $\beta$$\alpha$$\beta$-folds. This fingerprint is in fact a set of 11 rules describing the type of amino acid that should occur at a specific position in a peptide fragment. The total length of this fingerprint varies between 29 and 31 residues. By checking against all possible sequences in a database, it appeared that every peptide, which exactly follows this fingerprint, does indeed fold into an ADP-binding $\beta$$\alpha$$\beta$-unit.},

	volume = {11},
	issn = {1471-2105},
	doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-11-534},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Medium-chain Dehydrogenases/Reductases (MDR) form a protein superfamily whose size and complexity defeats traditional means of subclassification; it currently has over 15000 members in the databases, the pairwise sequence identity is typically around 25\%, there are members from all kingdoms of life, the chain-lengths vary as does the oligomericity, and the members are partaking in a multitude of biological processes. There are profile hidden Markov models (HMMs) available for detecting MDR superfamily members, but none for determining which MDR family each protein belongs to. The current torrential influx of new sequence data enables elucidation of more and more protein families, and at an increasingly fine granularity. However, gathering good quality training data usually requires manual attention by experts and has therefore been the rate limiting step for expanding the number of available models.
RESULTS: We have developed an automated algorithm for HMM refinement that produces stable and reliable models for protein families. This algorithm uses relationships found in data to generate confident seed sets. Using this algorithm we have produced HMMs for 86 distinct MDR families and 34 of their subfamilies which can be used in automated annotation of new sequences. We find that MDR forms with 2 Zn2+ ions in general are dehydrogenases, while MDR forms with no Zn2+ in general are reductases. Furthermore, in Bacteria MDRs without Zn2+ are more frequent than those with Zn2+, while the opposite is true for eukaryotic MDRs, indicating that Zn2+ has been recruited into the MDR superfamily after the initial life kingdom separations. We have also developed a web site http://mdr-enzymes.org that provides textual and numeric search against various characterised MDR family properties, as well as sequence scan functions for reliable classification of novel MDR sequences.
CONCLUSIONS: Our method of refinement can be readily applied to create stable and reliable HMMs for both MDR and other protein families, and to confidently subdivide large and complex protein superfamilies. HMMs created using this algorithm correspond to evolutionary entities, making resolution of overlapping models straightforward. The implementation and support scripts for running the algorithm on computer clusters are available as open source software, and the database files underlying the web site are freely downloadable. The web site also makes our findings directly useful also for non-bioinformaticians.},

Environment and residue pair specific contributions to the scoring functions appear as the first two terms in a series expansion for the residue probability distributions in the protein database; the decoupling of the distance and environment dependencies of the distributions resolves the major problems with current database-derived scoring functions noted by Thomas and Dill. The simulated annealing procedure rapidly and frequently generates native-like structures for small helical proteins and better than random structures for small beta sheet containing proteins. Most of the simulated structures have native-like solvent accessibility and secondary structure patterns, and thus ensembles of these structures provide a particularly challenging set of decoys for evaluating scoring functions. We investigate the effects of multiple sequence information and different types of conformational constraints on the overall performance of the method, and the ability of a variety of recently developed scoring functions to recognize the native-like conformations in the ensembles of simulated structures.},

A large active site pocket entails special substrate specificities: shortchain alcohols are poor substrates, while medium-chain alcohols and particularly the glutathione adducts S-hydroxymethylglutathione (HMGSH) and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) are efficiently converted under concomitant use of NAD(+)/NADH. By oxidation of HMGSH, the spontaneous glutathione adduct of formaldehyde, ADH3 is implicated in the detoxification of formaldehyde. Through the GSNO reductase activity, ADH3 can affect the transnitrosation equilibrium between GSNO and S-nitrosated proteins, arguing for an important role in NO homeostasis. Recent findings suggest that ADH3-mediated GSNO reduction and subsequent product formation responds to redox states in terms of NADH availability and glutathione levels. Finally, a dual function of ADH3 is discussed in view of its potential implications for asthma.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: BLAST is a commonly-used software package for comparing a query sequence to a database of known sequences; in this study, we focus on protein sequences. Position-specific-iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) iteratively searches a protein sequence database, using the matches in round i to construct a position-specific score matrix (PSSM) for searching the database in round i + 1. Biegert and Söding developed Context-sensitive BLAST (CS-BLAST), which combines information from searching the sequence database with information derived from a library of short protein profiles to achieve better homology detection than PSI-BLAST, which builds its PSSMs from scratch.
RESULTS: We describe a new method, called domain enhanced lookup time accelerated BLAST (DELTA-BLAST), which searches a database of pre-constructed PSSMs before searching a protein-sequence database, to yield better homology detection. For its PSSMs, DELTA-BLAST employs a subset of NCBI's Conserved Domain Database (CDD). On a test set derived from ASTRAL, with one round of searching, DELTA-BLAST achieves a ROC5000 of 0.270 vs. 0.116 for CS-BLAST. The performance advantage diminishes in iterated searches, but DELTA-BLAST continues to achieve better ROC scores than CS-BLAST.
CONCLUSIONS: DELTA-BLAST is a useful program for the detection of remote protein homologs. It is available under the "Protein BLAST" link at http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.},

	abstract = {Tumor suppressor p53 regulates the expression of p53-induced genes (PIG) that trigger apoptosis. PIG3 or TP53I3 is the only known member of the medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily induced by p53 and is used as a proapoptotic marker. Although the participation of PIG3 in the apoptotic pathway is proven, the protein and its mechanism of action were never characterized. We analyzed human PIG3 enzymatic function and found NADPH-dependent reductase activity with ortho-quinones, which is consistent with the classification of PIG3 in the quinone oxidoreductase family. However, the activity is much lower than that of zeta-crystallin, a better known quinone oxidoreductase. In addition, we report the crystallographic structure of PIG3, which allowed the identification of substrate- and cofactor-binding sites, with residues fully conserved from bacteria to human. Tyr-59 in zeta-crystallin (Tyr-51 in PIG3) was suggested to participate in the catalysis of quinone reduction. However, kinetics of Tyr/Phe and Tyr/Ala mutants of both enzymes demonstrated that the active site Tyr is not catalytic but may participate in substrate binding, consistent with a mechanism based on propinquity effects. It has been proposed that PIG3 contribution to apoptosis would be through oxidative stress generation. We found that in vitro activity and in vivo overexpression of PIG3 accumulate reactive oxygen species. Accordingly, an inactive PIG3 mutant (S151V) did not produce reactive oxygen species in cells, indicating that enzymatically active protein is necessary for this function. This supports that PIG3 action is through oxidative stress produced by its enzymatic activity and provides essential knowledge for eventual control of apoptosis.},

	abstract = {The nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution predicts larger generation-time effects for synonymous than for nonsynonymous substitutions. This prediction is tested using the sequences of 49 single-copy genes by calculating the average and variance of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions in mammalian star phylogenies (rodentia, artiodactyla, and primates). The average pattern of the 49 genes supports the prediction of the nearly neutral theory, with some notable exceptions. The nearly neutral theory also predicts that the variance of the evolutionary rate is larger than the value predicted by the completely neutral theory. This prediction is tested by examining the dispersion index (ratio of the variance to the mean), which is positively correlated with the average substitution number. After weighting by the lineage effects, this correlation almost disappears for nonsynonymous substitutions, but not quite so for synonymous substitutions. After weighting, the dispersion indices of both synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions still exceed values expected under the simple Poisson process. The results indicate that both the systematic bias in evolutionary rate among the lineages and the episodic type of rate variation are contributing to the large variance. The former is more significant to synonymous substitutions than to nonsynonymous substitutions. Isochore evolution may be similar to synonymous substitutions. The rate and pattern found here are consistent with the nearly neutral theory, such that the relative contributions of drift and selection differ between the two types of substitutions. The results are also consistent with Gillespie's episodic selection theory.},

Three families are formed by dimeric alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH; originally detected in animals/plants), cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenases (originally detected in plants) and tetrameric alcohol dehydrogenases (originally detected in yeast). Three further families are centred around forms initially detected as mitochondrial respiratory function proteins, acetyl-CoA reductases of fatty acid synthases, and leukotriene B4 dehydrogenases. The two remaining families with polyol dehydrogenases (originally detected as sorbitol dehydrogenase) and quinone reductases (originally detected as zeta-crystallin) are also distinct but with variable sequences. The most abundant families in the human genome are the dimeric ADH forms and the quinone oxidoreductases. The eukaryotic patterns are different from those of Escherichia coli.

The targets have homologous proteins with known three-dimensional structure with sequence identity ranging from 25 to 77\%. After alignment of the target sequence with the related three-dimensional structure, the modeling procedure consists of two subproblems: side-chain prediction and loop prediction. The ICM method approaches these problems with the following steps: (1) a starting model is created based on the homologous structure with the conserved portion fixed and the nonconserved portion having standard covalent geometry and free torsion angles; (2) the Biased Probability Monte Carlo (BPMC) procedure is applied to search the subspaces of either all the nonconservative side-chain torsion angles or torsion angles in a loop backbone and surrounding side chains. A special algorithm was designed to generate low-energy loop deformations. The BPMC procedure globally optimizes the energy function consisting of ECEPP/3 and solvation energy terms. Comparison of the predictions with the NMR or crystallographic solutions reveals a high proportion of correctly predicted side chains. The loops were not correctly predicted because imprinted distortions of the backbone increased the energy of the near-native conformation and thus made the solution unrecognizable. Interestingly, the energy terms were found to be reliable and the sampling of conformational space sufficient. The implications of this finding for the strategies of future comparative modeling are discussed.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Molecular simulation has historically been a low-throughput technique, but faster computers and increasing amounts of genomic and structural data are changing this by enabling large-scale automated simulation of, for instance, many conformers or mutants of biomolecules with or without a range of ligands. At the same time, advances in performance and scaling now make it possible to model complex biomolecular interaction and function in a manner directly testable by experiment. These applications share a need for fast and efficient software that can be deployed on massive scale in clusters, web servers, distributed computing or cloud resources.
RESULTS: Here, we present a range of new simulation algorithms and features developed during the past 4 years, leading up to the GROMACS 4.5 software package. The software now automatically handles wide classes of biomolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids and lipids, and comes with all commonly used force fields for these molecules built-in. GROMACS supports several implicit solvent models, as well as new free-energy algorithms, and the software now uses multithreading for efficient parallelization even on low-end systems, including windows-based workstations. Together with hand-tuned assembly kernels and state-of-the-art parallelization, this provides extremely high performance and cost efficiency for high-throughput as well as massively parallel simulations.
AVAILABILITY: GROMACS is an open source and free software available from http://www.gromacs.org.

	volume = {34},
	issn = {0006-2960},
	abstract = {Short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) constitute a large protein family. Presently, at least 57 characterized, highly different enzymes belong to this family and typically exhibit residue identities only at the 15-30\% level, indicating early duplicatory origins and extensive divergence. In addition, another family of 22 enzymes with extended protein chains exhibits part-chain SDR relationships and represents enzymes of no less than three EC classes. Furthermore, subforms and species variants are known of both families. In the combined SDR superfamily, only one residue is strictly conserved and ascribed a crucial enzymatic function (Tyr 151 in the numbering system of human NAD(+)-linked prostaglandin dehydrogenase). Such a function for this Tyr residue in SDR enzymes in general is supported also by chemical modifications, site-directed mutagenesis, and an active site position in those tertiary structures that have been characterized. A lysine residue four residues downstream is also largely conserved. A model for catalysis is available on the basis of these two residues. Binding of the coenzyme, NAD(H) or NADP(H), is in the N-terminal part of the molecules, where a common GlyXXXGlyXGly pattern occurs. Two SDR enzymes established by X-ray crystallography show a one-domain subunit with seven to eight beta-strands. Conformational patterns are highly similar, except for variations in the C-terminal parts. Additional structures occur in the family with extended chains. Some of the SDR molecules are known under more than one name, and one of the enzymes has been shown to be susceptible to native, chemical modification, producing reduced Schiff base adducts with pyruvate and other metabolic keto derivatives. Most SDR enzymes are dimers and tetramers. In those analyzed, the area of major subunit contacts involves two long alpha-helices (alpha E, alpha F) in similar and apparently strong subunit interactions. Future possibilities include verification of the proposed reaction mechanism and tracing of additional relationships, perhaps also with other protein families. Short-chain dehydrogenases illustrate the value of comparisons and diversified research in generating unexpected discoveries.},

The most important parameter is the stability measure of the mutated structure calculated using molecular modelling. For each mutant, a severity score is reported, which can be used for classification into deleterious and nondeleterious. Both structural features and sequence properties are taken into account. The method has a prediction accuracy of 77\% on all mutants and 88\% on breast cancer mutations affecting WAF1 promoter binding. When compared with earlier methods, using the same dataset, our method clearly performs better. As a result of the severity score calculated for every mutant, valuable knowledge can be gained regarding p53, a protein that is believed to be involved in over 50\% of all human cancers.},

We present ProbCons, a practical tool for progressive protein multiple sequence alignment based on probabilistic consistency, and evaluate its performance on several standard alignment benchmark data sets.

Sequence data have been obtained at cDNA and genomic levels, but limited data are available for functionality and substrate repertoire. The low positional identity (65\%) between the two ADHs, place them into separate classes. We have shown that the ADH5 gene yields two differently processed mRNAs and harbors a gene organization identical to other mammalian ADHs. This is probably due to an alternative splicing in the eighth intron that results in a shorter message missing the ninth exon or a normal message with the expected number of codons. The isolated rat ADH6 cDNA was found to be fused to ADH2 at the 5′-end. The resulting main open reading frame translates into an N-terminally extended polypeptide. In vitro translation results in a polypeptide of about 42 kDa and further, protein was possible to express in COS cells as a fusion product with Green Fluorescent Protein. Both ADH5 and ADH6 show genes and gene products that are processed comparably to other mammalian ADHs and the deduced amino acid sequences indicate a lack of ethanol dehydrogenase activity that probably explains why no corresponding proteins have been isolated. The functionality of these ADHs is therefore still an enigma.},

For human ADH2, the determined K(m) values ranged from 0.05 to 0.3 microM and k(cat) values from 2.3 to 17.6 min(-1), while the catalytic efficiency for 9-cis-retinol showed the highest value for any substrate. In contrast, poor activities were detected for the rodent enzymes. A mouse ADH2 mutant (ADH2Pro47His) was studied that resembles the human ADH2 setup. This mutation increased the retinoid activity up to 100-fold. The K(m) values of human ADH2 are the lowest among all known human retinol dehydrogenases, which clearly support a role in hepatic retinol oxidation at physiological concentrations.},

	abstract = {The structure of mouse class II alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH2) has been determined in a binary complex with the coenzyme NADH and in a ternary complex with both NADH and the inhibitor N-cyclohexylformamide to 2.2 A and 2.1 A resolution, respectively. The ADH2 dimer is asymmetric in the crystal with different orientations of the catalytic domains relative to the coenzyme-binding domains in the two subunits, resulting in a slightly different closure of the active-site cleft. Both conformations are about half way between the open apo structure and the closed holo structure of horse ADH1, thus resembling that of ADH3. The semi-open conformation and structural differences around the active-site cleft contribute to a substantially different substrate-binding pocket architecture as compared to other classes of alcohol dehydrogenase, and provide the structural basis for recognition and selectivity of alcohols and quinones. The active-site cleft is more voluminous than that of ADH1 but not as open and funnel-shaped as that of ADH3. The loop with residues 296-301 from the coenzyme-binding domain is short, thus opening up the pocket towards the coenzyme. On the opposite side, the loop with residues 114-121 stretches out over the inter-domain cleft. A cavity is formed below this loop and adds an appendix to the substrate-binding pocket. Asp301 is positioned at the entrance of the pocket and may control the binding of omega-hydroxy fatty acids, which act as inhibitors rather than substrates. Mouse ADH2 is known as an inefficient ADH with a slow hydrogen-transfer step. By replacing Pro47 with His, the alcohol dehydrogenase activity is restored. Here, the structure of this P47H mutant was determined in complex with NADH to 2.5 A resolution. His47 is suitably positioned to act as a catalytic base in the deprotonation of the substrate. Moreover, in the more closed subunit, the coenzyme is allowed a position closer to the catalytic zinc. This is consistent with hydrogen transfer from an alcoholate intermediate where the Pro/His replacement focuses on the function of the enzyme.},

For each feature, we determined the relevance, computational burden, usage statistics and the functionality of the feature in a website context. As a consequence of this review, we have removed some features, enhanced others and developed new ones to meet the changing demands of computational biology.

Several primate genomes are completely analyzed for the ADH region, where higher primates (human and hominoids) have seven genes of classes ADH1–ADH5. Within the group of non-hominoids apes there have been further duplications and species with more than the typical three isozymic forms for ADH1 are present. In contrast there are few completely analyzed ADH genomes in the non-primate group of mammals, where an additional class has been identified, ADH6, that has been lost during the evolution of primates. In this study 85 mammalian genomes with at least one ADH gene have been compiled. In total more than 500 ADH amino acid sequences were analyzed for patterns that distinguish the different classes.

For ADH1–ADH4 intensive investigations have been performed both at the functional and at structural levels. However, a corresponding functional protein to the ADH5 gene, which is found in most ADH genomes, has never been detected. The same is true for ADH6, which is only present in non-primates.

The entire mammalian ADH family shows a broad spectrum of gene duplications and gene losses where the numbers differ from six genes (most non-primate mammals) up to ten genes (vole). Included in these sets are examples of pseudogenes and pseudoenzymes.},

We report simulations of several folding trajectories of NTL9(1?39), a protein which has a folding time of ?1.5 ms. Distributed molecular dynamics simulations in implicit solvent on GPU processors were used to generate ensembles of trajectories out to ?40 ?s for several temperatures and starting states. At a temperature less than the melting point of the force field, we observe a small number of productive folding events, consistent with predictions from a model of parallel uncoupled two-state simulations. The posterior distribution of the folding rate predicted from the data agrees well with the experimental folding rate (?640/s). Markov State Models (MSMs) built from the data show a gap in the implied time scales indicative of two-state folding and heterogeneous pathways connecting diffuse mesoscopic substates. Structural analysis of the 14 out of 2000 macrostates transited by the top 10 folding pathways reveals that native-like pairing between strands 1 and 2 only occurs for macrostates with pfold {\textgreater} 0.5, suggesting ?12 hairpin formation may be rate-limiting. We believe that using simulation data such as these to seed adaptive resampling simulations will be a promising new method for achieving statistically converged descriptions of folding landscapes at longer time scales than ever before.},

	abstract = {The C-peptide of proinsulin exhibits multiple activities and several of the underlying molecular interactions are known. We recently showed that human C-peptide is sub-divided into a tripartite architecture and that the pattern, rather than the exact residue positions, is a characteristic feature. We have now analyzed 75 proinsulins, ranging from fish to human and find a limited co-evolution with insulin, but with many marked deviations. This suggests a complex relationship, in which not only insulin affects the evolution of C-peptide. A subdivided nature, however, is a characteristic feature among all C-peptides, with the N-terminal segment the one most conserved. This segment, ascribed chaperoning charge-interactions with insulin, suggests that the insulin interactions constitute a basic function, although largely shifting from Glu to Asp residues in C-peptides of lower life forms. A second conserved feature is a mid-segment with a high content of adjacent Pro and Gly residues, in mammalian C-peptides compatible with a turn structure, but with fewer and more distantly interspaced such residues in the non-mammalian forms, and even absent in several fish forms. However, this segment of coelacanth C-peptide possesses a unique Cys distribution, capable of forming a disulfide-stabilized turn. Finally, the C-terminal segment of mammalian C-peptides, ascribed a possible receptor-interacting function, is not really discernable in the sub-mammalian forms. Combined, these patterns suggest an evolutionary stepwise acquisition of the tripartite mammalian C-peptide molecule, with insulin-interaction being ancestral, various turn stabilizations apparently of intermediate emergence, and possible receptor-interaction the most recent addition.},

	abstract = {Four genetic variants of alcohol dehydrogenase from Drosophila melanogaster have been examined: wild-type F-enzyme (from the AdhF strain), the D-type mutant form (from the AdhD strain), which is catalytically active, and two proteins lacking enzymic activity (from the Adhn11 and Adhn5 strains). The proteins were compared by mapping of tryptic peptides. One pair of difference peptides was seen in the comparisons of the D and F-type enzymes. These peptides were purified and their sequences determined. The difference between the two proteins was shown to be an exchange at a single position of glycine in the F for glutamic acid in the D-type protein. This exchange is consistent with the greater acidity of alcohol dehydrogenase from the AdhD strain and can be produced by a single base mutation. The difference between the n11 and F-type proteins was not detected and is suggested to be in a large tryptic peptide. In addition to the difference peptides, other fragments from Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase were isolated and analyzed. The sequences determined account for approximately 50\% of the amino acids in the protein and include regions around the two cysteine residues as well as possible terminal structures. All peptides analyzed were examined for structural identities with horse and yeast alcohol dehydrogenases. No clearly significant similarities were seen between the Drosophila enzyme and the other two proteins but low degrees of homology are possible. From the variations in cysteine-containing regions large differences appear to exist between the active sites of the insect enzyme and the other alcohol dehydrogenases.},

	abstract = {ADH2 is a member of one of the six classes of mammalian alcohol dehydrogenases, which catalyze the reversible oxidation of alcohols using NAD(+) as a cofactor. Within the ADH2 class, the rodent enzymes form a subgroup that exhibits low catalytic activity with all substrates that were examined, as compared to other groups, such as human ADH2. The low activity can be ascribed to the rigid nature of the proline residue at position 47 as the activity can be increased by approximately 100-fold by substituting Pro47 with either His (as found in human ADH2), Ala, or Gln. Mouse ADH2 follows an ordered bi-bi mechanism, and hydride transfer is rate-limiting for oxidation of benzyl alcohols catalyzed by the mutated and wild-type enzymes. Structural studies suggest that the mouse enzyme with His47 has a more closed active site, as compared to the enzyme with Pro47, and hydride transfer can be more efficient. Oxidation of benzyl alcohol catalyzed by all forms of the enzyme is strongly pH dependent, with pK values in the range of 8.1-9.3 for turnover numbers and catalytic efficiency. These pK values probably correspond to the ionization of the zinc-bound water or alcohol. The pK values are not lowered by the Pro47 to His substitution, suggesting that His47 does not act as a catalytic base in the deprotonation of the zinc ligand.},

Disease-associated mutations are well known, but wild-type TTR is, to a lesser extent, also amyloidogenic. Monomerization, not oligomer formation as in several other depository diseases, is the rate-limiting step in TTR aggregation, and stabilization of the natively tetrameric form can inhibit amyloid formation. Modifications on Cys10, as well as interactions with native ligands in plasma, were early found to influence the equilibrium between tetrameric and monomeric TTR by dissociating or stabilizing the tetramer. Following these discoveries, synthetic ligands for pharmacological prevention of TTR aggregation could be developed. In this article, we outline how the different types of TTR interactions and its microheterogeneity in plasma are related to its propensity to form amyloid fibrils. We conclude that plasma constituents and dietary components may act as natural TTR stabilizers whose mechanisms of action provide cues for the amelioration of TTR amyloid disease.},

The ADH1 enzymes, the classical liver forms, are involved in several metabolic pathways beside the oxidation of ethanol, e.g. norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin and bile acid metabolism. This class is also able to further oxidize aldehydes into the corresponding carboxylic acids, i.e. dismutation. ADH2, can be divided into two subgroups, one group consisting of the human enzyme together with a rabbit form and another consisting of the rodent forms. The rodent enzymes almost lack ethanol-oxidizing capacity in contrast to the human form, indicating that rodents are poor model systems for human ethanol metabolism. ADH3 (identical to glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase) is clearly the ancestral ADH form and S-hydroxymethylglutathione is the main physiological substrate, but the enzyme can still oxidize ethanol at high concentrations. ADH4 is solely extrahepatically expressed and is probably involved in first pass metabolism of ethanol beside its role in retinol metabolism. The higher classes, ADH5 and ADH6, have been poorly investigated and their substrate repertoire is unknown. The entire ADH system can be seen as a general detoxifying system for alcohols and aldehydes without generating toxic radicals in contrast to the cytochrome P450 system.},

	abstract = {Comparative modeling predicts the three-dimensional structure of a given protein sequence (target) based primarily on its alignment to one or more proteins of known structure (templates). The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target-template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. The number of protein sequences that can be modeled and the accuracy of the predictions are increasing steadily because of the growth in the number of known protein structures and because of the improvements in the modeling software. Further advances are necessary in recognizing weak sequence-structure similarities, aligning sequences with structures, modeling of rigid body shifts, distortions, loops and side chains, as well as detecting errors in a model. Despite these problems, it is currently possible to model with useful accuracy significant parts of approximately one third of all known protein sequences. The use of individual comparative models in biology is already rewarding and increasingly widespread. A major new challenge for comparative modeling is the integration of it with the torrents of data from genome sequencing projects as well as from functional and structural genomics. In particular, there is a need to develop an automated, rapid, robust, sensitive, and accurate comparative modeling pipeline applicable to whole genomes. Such large-scale modeling is likely to encourage new kinds of applications for the many resulting models, based on their large number and completeness at the level of the family, organism, or functional network.},

	abstract = {Five models by homology containing insertions and deletions and ranging from 33\% to 48\% sequence identity to the known homologue, and one high sequence identity (85\%) model were built for the CASP2 meeting. For all five low identity targets: (i) our starting models were improved by the Internal Coordinate Mechanics (ICM) energy optimization, (ii) the refined models were consistently better than those built with the automatic SWISS-MODEL program, and (iii) the refined models differed by less than 2\% from the best model submitted, as judged by the residue contact area difference (CAD) measure [Abagyan, R.A., Totrov, M.J. Mol. Biol. 268:678-685, 1997]. The CAD measure is proposed for ranking models built by homology instead of global root-mean-square deviation, which is frequently dominated by insignificant yet large contributions from incorrectly predicted fragments or side chains. We demonstrate that the precise identification of regions of local backbone deviation is an independent and crucial step in the homology modeling procedure after alignment, since aligned fragments can strongly deviate from the template at various distances from the alignment gap or even in the ungapped parts of the alignment. We show that a local alignment score can be used as an indicator of such local deviation. While four short loops of the meeting targets were predicted by database search, the best loop 1 target T0028, for which the correct database fragment was not found, was predicted by Internal Coordinate Mechanics global energy optimization at 1.2 A accuracy. A classification scheme for errors in homology modeling is proposed.},

	abstract = {Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) alcohol dehydrogenase I (ADH1) is the constitutive enzyme that reduces acetaldehyde to ethanol during the fermentation of glucose. ADH1 is a homotetramer of subunits with 347 amino acid residues. A structure for ADH1 was determined by X-ray crystallography at 2.4 Å resolution. The asymmetric unit contains four different subunits, arranged as similar dimers named AB and CD. The unit cell contains two different tetramers made up of ?back-to-back? dimers, AB:AB and CD:CD. The A and C subunits in each dimer are structurally similar, with a closed conformation, bound coenzyme, and the oxygen of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol ligated to the catalytic zinc in the classical tetrahedral coordination with Cys-43, Cys-153, and His-66. In contrast, the B and D subunits have an open conformation with no bound coenzyme, and the catalytic zinc has an alternative, inverted coordination with Cys-43, Cys-153, His-66, and the carboxylate of Glu-67. The asymmetry in the dimeric subunits of the tetramer provides two structures that appear to be relevant for the catalytic mechanism. The alternative coordination of the zinc may represent an intermediate in the mechanism of displacement of the zinc-bound water with alcohol or aldehyde substrates. Substitution of Glu-67 with Gln-67 decreases the catalytic efficiency by 100-fold. Previous studies of structural modeling, evolutionary relationships, substrate specificity, chemical modification, and site-directed mutagenesis are interpreted more fully with the three-dimensional structure.},

We also focused on the significance of some implementations embedded in algorithm of each tool. Based on 10 simulated trees of different number of taxa generated by R, 400 known alignments and sequence files were constructed using indel-Seq-Gen. A total of 4000 test alignments were generated to study the effect of sequence length, indel size, deletion rate, and insertion rate. Results showed that alignment quality was highly dependent on the number of deletions and insertions in the sequences and that the sequence length and indel size had a weaker effect. Overall, ProbCons was consistently on the top of list of the evaluated MSA tools. SATe, being little less accurate, was 529.10\% faster than ProbCons and 236.72\% faster than MAFFT(L-INS-i). Among other tools, Kalign and MUSCLE achieved the highest sum of pairs.

	abstract = {Comparative protein structure prediction is limited mostly by the errors in alignment and loop modeling. We describe here a new automated modeling technique that significantly improves the accuracy of loop predictions in protein structures. The positions of all nonhydrogen atoms of the loop are optimized in a fixed environment with respect to a pseudo energy function. The energy is a sum of many spatial restraints that include the bond length, bond angle, and improper dihedral angle terms from the CHARMM-22 force field, statistical preferences for the main-chain and side-chain dihedral angles, and statistical preferences for nonbonded atomic contacts that depend on the two atom types, their distance through space, and separation in sequence. The energy function is optimized with the method of conjugate gradients combined with molecular dynamics and simulated annealing. Typically, the predicted loop conformation corresponds to the lowest energy conformation among 500 independent optimizations. Predictions were made for 40 loops of known structure at each length from 1 to 14 residues. The accuracy of loop predictions is evaluated as a function of thoroughness of conformational sampling, loop length, and structural properties of native loops. When accuracy is measured by local superposition of the model on the native loop, 100, 90, and 30\% of 4-, 8-, and 12-residue loop predictions, respectively, had {\textless}2 A RMSD error for the mainchain N, C(alpha), C, and O atoms; the average accuracies were 0.59 +/- 0.05, 1.16 +/- 0.10, and 2.61 +/- 0.16 A, respectively. To simulate real comparative modeling problems, the method was also evaluated by predicting loops of known structure in only approximately correct environments with errors typical of comparative modeling without misalignment. When the RMSD distortion of the main-chain stem atoms is 2.5 A, the average loop prediction error increased by 180, 25, and 3\% for 4-, 8-, and 12-residue loops, respectively. The accuracy of the lowest energy prediction for a given loop can be estimated from the structural variability among a number of low energy predictions. The relative value of the present method is gauged by (1) comparing it with one of the most successful previously described methods, and (2) describing its accuracy in recent blind predictions of protein structure. Finally, it is shown that the average accuracy of prediction is limited primarily by the accuracy of the energy function rather than by the extent of conformational sampling.},

	abstract = {Acetaminophen is one of the most widely used over-the-counter analgesic, antipyretic medications. Use of acetaminophen and alcohol are commonly associated. Previous studies showed that acetaminophen might affect bioavailability of ethanol by inhibiting gastric alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). However, potential inhibitions by acetaminophen of first-pass metabolism (FPM) of ethanol, catalyzed by the human ADH family and by relevant aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) isozymes, remain undefined. ADH and ALDH both exhibit racially distinct allozymes and tissue-specific distribution of isozymes, and are principal enzymes responsible for ethanol metabolism in humans. In this study, we investigated acetaminophen inhibition of ethanol oxidation with recombinant human ADH1A, ADH1B1, ADH1B2, ADH1B3, ADH1C1, ADH1C2, ADH2, and ADH4, and inhibition of acetaldehyde oxidation with recombinant human ALDH1A1 and ALDH2. The investigations were done at near physiological pH 7.5 and with a cytoplasmic coenzyme concentration of 0.5 mm NAD+. Acetaminophen acted as a noncompetitive inhibitor for ADH enzymes, with the slope inhibition constants (Kis) ranging from 0.90 mm (ADH2) to 20 mm (ADH1A), and the intercept inhibition constants (Kii) ranging from 1.4 mm (ADH1C allozymes) to 19 mm (ADH1A). Acetaminophen exhibited noncompetitive inhibition for ALDH2 (Kis = 3.0 mm and Kii = 2.2 mm), but competitive inhibition for ALDH1A1 (Kis = 0.96 mm). The metabolic interactions between acetaminophen and ethanol/acetaldehyde were assessed by computer simulation using inhibition equations and the determined kinetic constants. At therapeutic to subtoxic plasma levels of acetaminophen (i.e., 0.2–0.5 mm) and physiologically relevant concentrations of ethanol (10 mm) and acetaldehyde (10 μm) in target tissues, acetaminophen could inhibit ADH1C allozymes (12–26\%) and ADH2 (14–28\%) in the liver and small intestine, ADH4 (15–31\%) in the stomach, and ALDH1A1 (16–33\%) and ALDH2 (8.3–19\%) in all 3 tissues. The results suggest that inhibition by acetaminophen of hepatic and gastrointestinal FPM of ethanol through ADH and ALDH pathways might become significant at higher, subtoxic levels of acetaminophen.},

	abstract = {All four cysteine ligands to the structural zinc atom of human class-I and class-III alcohol dehydrogenase have been exchanged by site-directed mutagenesis in order to study the importance of the metal in the mammalian enzymes. The cysteine residues were replaced with Ala and Ser, residues that are not able to ligand zinc. All mutations resulted in inactive, unstable enzymes, in contrast to the non-mutated human alcohol dehydrogenases that are easily isolated. Northern-blot analysis revealed the presence of the expected mRNAs from expression plasmids constructed with the different mutated and non-mutated alcohol dehydrogenases, and Western-blot analysis gave faint signals for the mutated recombinant proteins from crude extracts. This verifies that the plasmid constructs are correct, but that the translated, mutated proteins lacking the zinc-stabilized local fold, are subject to rapid degradation. Hence, the results directly illustrate the importance of the structural zinc atom in mammalian alcohol dehydrogenase and confirm it as a component with 'structural' properties. The results are compatible with those from sensitivities to proteases and from the structures of other proteins within the super-family, indicating that the structural role of the zinc atom may involve conservation of interfaces regulating the enzyme quaternary structure.},

The ADH2 enzymes show further complexity among the species, e.g. in enzymatic characteristics where the rodent forms essentially lack ethanol-oxidizing capacity. ADH3 (glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase) has been shown to catalyze the reductive breakdown of S-nitrosoglutathione, indicating involvement in nitric oxide metabolism. Mass spectrometry identified the major enzymatic product as glutathione sulfinamide. This reductive breakdown directly interferes with the formaldehyde scavenging that has been proposed to be the physiological action of ADH3. The human ADH5 and rodent ADH6 seem to be the corresponding enzymes due to their similar behavior. None of these latter ADHs have so far been assigned to any function.

	abstract = {Structural and kinetic properties of the human 2-enoyl thioester reductase [mitochondrial enoyl–coenzyme A reductase (MECR)/ETR1] of the mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (FAS) II pathway have been determined. The crystal structure of this dimeric enzyme (at 2.4 Å resolution) suggests that the binding site for the recognition helix of the acyl carrier protein is in a groove between the two adjacent monomers. This groove is connected via the pantetheine binding cleft to the active site. The modeled mode of NADPH binding, using molecular dynamics calculations, suggests that Tyr94 and Trp311 are critical for catalysis, which is supported by enzyme kinetic data. A deep, water-filled pocket, shaped by hydrophobic and polar residues and extending away from the catalytic site, was recognized. This pocket can accommodate a fatty acyl tail of up to 16 carbons. Mutagenesis of the residues near the end of this pocket confirms the importance of this region for the binding of substrate molecules with long fatty acyl tails. Furthermore, the kinetic analysis of the wild-type MECR/ETR1 shows a bimodal distribution of catalytic efficiencies, in agreement with the notion that two major products are generated by the mitochondrial FAS II pathway.},

	abstract = {The binding of zinc (Zn) ions to proteins is important for many cellular events. The theoretical and computational description of this binding (as well as that of other transition metals) is a challenging task. In this paper the binding of the Zn ion to four cysteine residues in the structural site of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH) is studied using a synthetic peptide mimic of this site. The study includes experimental measurements of binding constants, classical free energy calculations from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and quantum mechanical (QM) electron structure calculations. The classical MD results account for interactions at the molecular level and reproduce the absolute binding energy and the hydration free energy of the Zn ion with an accuracy of about 10\%. This is insufficient to obtain correct free energy differences. QM correction terms were calculated from density functional theory (DFT) on small clusters of atoms to include electronic polarisation of the closest waters and covalent contributions to the Zn–S coordination bond. This results in reasonably good agreement with the experimentally measured binding constants and Zn ion hydration free energies in agreement with published experimental values. The study also includes the replacement of one cysteine residue to an alanine. Simulations as well as experiments showed only a small effect of this upon the binding free energy. A detailed analysis indicate that the sulfur is replaced by three water molecules, thereby changing the coordination number of Zn from four (as in the original peptide) to six (as in water).},

Second, rather than setting specific distance cutoffs and calculating only the fractions with errors below the cutoff, all residue pairs in alignment/modeling are evaluated in the proposed score. For comparison of various scoring functions, we have constructed a large-scale benchmark set of structure templates for 1489 small to medium size proteins using the threading program PROSPECTOR\_3 and built the full-length models using MODELLER and TASSER. The TM-score of the initial threading alignments, compared to the GDT and MaxSub scoring functions, shows a much stronger correlation to the quality of the final full-length models. The TM-score is further exploited as an assessment of all 'new fold' targets in the recent CASP5 experiment and shows a close coincidence with the results of human-expert visual assessment. These data suggest that the TM-score is a useful complement to the fully automated assessment of protein structure predictions.

Endogenous regulation on the enzyme activity in response to environmental cues is critical in modulating tissue concentration of mannitol, which, importantly, contribute to stress tolerance of celery. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity from celery suspension cultures grown on D-mannitol as the carbon source. Mannitol dehydrogenase was purified 589-fold to a specific activity of 365 mumol h-1 mg-1 protein with a 37\% yield of enzyme activity present in the crude extract. A highly efficient and simple purification protocol was developed involving polyethylene glycol fractionation, diethylaminoethyl-anion-exchange chromatography, and NAD-agarose affinity chromatography using NAD gradient elution. Sodium dodecylsulfate gel electrophoresis of the final preparation revealed a single 40-kD protein. The molecular mass of the native protein was determined to be approximately 43 kD, indicating that the enzyme is a monomer. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the enzyme inhibited enzymatic activity of purified mannitol dehydrogenase. Immunoblots of crude protein extracts from mannitol-grown celery cells and sink tissues of celery, celeriac, and parsley subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis showed a single major immuno-reactive 40-kD protein.},

	abstract = {The evolutionary trajectory of a protein through sequence space is constrained by its function. Collections of sequence homologs record the outcomes of millions of evolutionary experiments in which the protein evolves according to these constraints. Deciphering the evolutionary record held in these sequences and exploiting it for predictive and engineering purposes presents a formidable challenge. The potential benefit of solving this challenge is amplified by the advent of inexpensive high-throughput genomic sequencing., In this paper we ask whether we can infer evolutionary constraints from a set of sequence homologs of a protein. The challenge is to distinguish true co-evolution couplings from the noisy set of observed correlations. We address this challenge using a maximum entropy model of the protein sequence, constrained by the statistics of the multiple sequence alignment, to infer residue pair couplings. Surprisingly, we find that the strength of these inferred couplings is an excellent predictor of residue-residue proximity in folded structures. Indeed, the top-scoring residue couplings are sufficiently accurate and well-distributed to define the 3D protein fold with remarkable accuracy., We quantify this observation by computing, from sequence alone, all-atom 3D structures of fifteen test proteins from different fold classes, ranging in size from 50 to 260 residues., including a G-protein coupled receptor. These blinded inferences are de novo, i.e., they do not use homology modeling or sequence-similar fragments from known structures. The co-evolution signals provide sufficient information to determine accurate 3D protein structure to 2.7–4.8 Å C$\alpha$-RMSD error relative to the observed structure, over at least two-thirds of the protein (method called EVfold, details at http://EVfold.org). This discovery provides insight into essential interactions constraining protein evolution and will facilitate a comprehensive survey of the universe of protein structures, new strategies in protein and drug design, and the identification of functional genetic variants in normal and disease genomes.},

	abstract = {Adipocyte differentiation is a multistep program under regulation by several factors. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor $\gamma$ (PPAR$\gamma$) serves as a master regulator of adipogenesis. However, the endogenous ligand for PPAR$\gamma$ remained elusive until 15-keto-PGE2 was identified recently as an endogenous PPAR$\gamma$ ligand. In this study, we demonstrate that zinc-containing alcohol dehydrogenase 2 (ZADH2; here termed prostaglandin reductase-3, PTGR-3) is a new member of prostaglandin reductase family that converts 15-keto-PGE2 to 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE2. Adipogenesis is accelerated when endogenous PTGR-3 is silenced in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, whereas forced expression of PTGR-3 significantly decreases adipogenesis. PTGR-3 expression decreased during adipocyte differentiation, accompanied by an increased level of 15-keto-PGE2. 15-keto-PGE2 exerts a potent proadipogenic effect by enhancing PPAR$\gamma$ activity, whereas overexpression of PTGR-3 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes markedly suppressed the proadipogenic effect of 15-keto-PGE2 by repressing PPAR$\gamma$ activity. Taken together, these findings demonstrate for the first time that PTGR-3 is a novel 15-oxoprostaglandin-Δ(13)-reductase and plays a critical role in modulation of normal adipocyte differentiation via regulation of PPAR$\gamma$ activity. Thus, modulation of PTGR-3 might provide a novel avenue for treating obesity and related metabolic disorders.},

Both enzymes are able to reduce ortho-quinones in the presence of NADPH but are not active with 2-alkenals. Deletion of the ZTA1 gene makes yeast more sensitive to menadione and hydrogen peroxide, suggesting a role in the oxidative stress response. The human and yeast enzymes specifically bind to adenine-uracil rich elements (ARE) in RNA, indicating that both enzymes are ARE-binding proteins and that this property has been conserved in zeta-crystallins throughout evolution.

	abstract = {Background and aims Human VAT-1 (hVAT-1) is a homologue of the synaptic vesicle membrane protein of Torpedo californica. Its coding gene is located near the BRCA1 locus and thus hVAT-1 may be linked to an inherited predisposition to breast and ovary cancer. However, the hVAT-1 protein expression pattern in normal epithelial tissues such as skin, mammary gland and ovary, as well as in tumours of the mammary gland and ovary, has not been studied. Methods To address this issue, an immunohistological analysis of biopsies of normal epidermis and lesional epidermis of bullous pemphigoid and pemphigus vulgaris patients was undertaken. Results hVAT-1-expression was observed in basal keratinocytes of lesional epidermis of bullous pemphigoid patients but not in normal epidermis or in lesional epidermis of pemphigus vulgaris patients. Moreover, hVAT-1 expression in HaCaT cells was found to be calcium-dependent. Normal and malignant mammary and ovary epithelium were found to be hVAT-1-negative. Conclusions Our results indicate that hVAT-1 exerts a specific function in keratinocyte physiology, in particular in calcium-regulated processes, with no evident deregulation in malignancies of the breast and ovary.},

In this review we explore new findings in the emerging pseudokinase and pseudophosphatase fields, and discuss their different modes of action which include exciting new roles as scaffolds, anchors, spatial modulators, traps, and ligand-driven regulators of canonical kinases and phosphatases. Thus, it is now apparent that pseudokinases and pseudophosphatases both support and drive a panoply of signaling networks. Finally, we highlight recent evidence on their involvement in human pathologies, marking them as potential novel drug targets.},

	abstract = {The alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) gene family encodes enzymes that metabolize a wide variety of substrates, including ethanol, retinol, other aliphatic alcohols, hydroxysteroids, and lipid peroxidation products. Studies on 19 vertebrate animals have identified ADH orthologs across several species, and this has now led to questions of how best to name ADH proteins and genes. Seven distinct classes of vertebrate ADH encoded by non-orthologous genes have been defined based upon sequence homology as well as unique catalytic properties or gene expression patterns. Each class of vertebrate ADH shares \&lt;70\% sequence identity with other classes of ADH in the same species. Classes may be further divided into multiple closely related isoenzymes sharing \&gt;80\% sequence identity such as the case for class I ADH where humans have three class I ADH genes, horses have two, and mice have only one. Presented here is a nomenclature that uses the widely accepted vertebrate ADH class system as its basis. It follows the guidelines of human and mouse gene nomenclature committees, which recommend coordinating names across species boundaries and eliminating Roman numerals and Greek symbols. We recommend that enzyme subunits be referred to by the symbol “ADH” (alcohol dehydrogenase) followed by an Arabic number denoting the class; i.e. ADH1 for class I ADH. For genes we recommend the italicized root symbol “ADH” for human and “Adh” for mouse, followed by the appropriate Arabic number for the class; i.e. ADH1 or Adh1 for class I ADH genes. For organisms where multiple species-specific isoenzymes exist within a class, we recommend adding a capital letter after the Arabic number; i.e. ADH1A, ADH1B, and ADH1C for human $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ class I ADHs, respectively. This nomenclature will accommodate newly discovered members of the vertebrate ADH family, and will facilitate functional and evolutionary studies.},

	abstract = {The active-site zinc in human glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FDH) undergoes coenzyme-induced displacement and transient coordination to a highly conserved glutamate residue (Glu-67) during the catalytic cycle. The role of this transient coordination of the active-site zinc to Glu-67 in the FDH catalytic cycle and the associated coenzyme interactions were investigated by studying enzymes in which Glu-67 and Arg-368 were substituted with Leu. Structures of FDH.adenosine 5'-diphosphate ribose (ADP-ribose) and E67L.NAD(H) binary complexes were determined. Steady-state kinetics, isotope effects, and presteady-state analysis of the E67L enzyme show that Glu-67 is critical for capturing the substrates for catalysis. The catalytic efficiency (V/K(m)) of the E67L enzyme in reactions involving S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), S-hydroxymethylglutathione (HMGSH) and 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid (12-HDDA) were 25 000-, 3000-, and 180-fold lower, respectively, than for the wild-type enzyme. The large decrease in the efficiency of capturing GSNO and HMGSH by the E67L enzyme results mainly because of the impaired binding of these substrates to the mutant enzyme. In the case of 12-HDDA, a decrease in the rate of hydride transfer is the major factor responsible for the reduction in the efficiency of its capture for catalysis by the E67L enzyme. Binding of the coenzyme is not affected by the Glu-67 substitution. A partial displacement of the active-site zinc in the FDH.ADP-ribose binary complex indicates that the disruption of the interaction between Glu-67 and Arg-368 is involved in the displacement of active-site zinc. Kinetic studies with the R368L enzyme show that the predominant role of Arg-368 is in the binding of the coenzyme. An isomerization of the ternary complex before hydride transfer is detected in the kinetic pathway of HMGSH. Steps involved in the binding of the coenzyme to the FDH active site are also discerned from the unique conformation of the coenzyme in one of the subunits of the E67L.NAD(H) binary complex.},

Because of the algorithm's efficiency on many microcomputers, sensitive protein database searches may now become a routine procedure for molecular biologists. The method efficiently identifies regions of similar sequence and then scores the aligned identical and differing residues in those regions by means of an amino acid replacability matrix. This matrix increases sensitivity by giving high scores to those amino acid replacements which occur frequently in evolution. The algorithm has been implemented in a computer program designed to search protein databases very rapidly. For example, comparison of a 200-amino-acid sequence to the 500,000 residues in the National Biomedical Research Foundation library would take less than 2 minutes on a minicomputer, and less than 10 minutes on a microcomputer (IBM PC).},

	abstract = {Enhanced understanding of structure-function relationships of human 21-hydroxylase, CYP21, is required to better understand the molecular causes of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. To this end, a structural model of human CYP21 was calculated based on the crystal structure of rabbit CYP2C5. All but two known allelic variants of missense type, a total of 60 disease-causing mutations and six normal variants, were analyzed using this model. A structural explanation for the corresponding phenotype was found for all but two mutants for which available clinical data are also discrepant with in vitro enzyme activity. Calculations of protein stability of modeled mutants were found to correlate inversely with the corresponding clinical severity. Putative structurally important residues were identified to be involved in heme and substrate binding, redox partner interaction, and enzyme catalysis using docking calculations and analysis of structurally determined homologous cytochrome P450s (CYPs). Functional and structural consequences of seven novel mutations, V139E, C147R, R233G, T295N, L308F, R366C, and M473I, detected in Scandinavian patients with suspected congenital adrenal hyperplasia of different severity, were predicted using molecular modeling. Structural features deduced from the models are in good correlation with clinical severity of CYP21 mutants, which shows the applicability of a modeling approach in assessment of new CYP21 mutations.},

In addition, two proteins with hitherto unknown function are shown to belong to this super-family of medium-chain dehydrogenases and reductases (MDR). Alignment of zeta-crystallins/quinone oxidoreductases/VAT-1 reveals 38 strictly conserved residues, of which approximately half are glycine residues, including those at several space-restricted turn positions and critical coenzyme-binding positions in the alcohol dehydrogenases. This indicates a conserved three-dimensional structure at the corresponding parts of these distantly related proteins and a conserved binding of a coenzyme in the two proteins with hitherto unknown function, thus ascribing a likely oxidoreductase function to these proteins. When all forms are aligned, including enoyl reductases, a zeta-crystallin homologue from Leishmania and the two proteins with hitherto unknown function, only three residues are strictly conserved among the 106 proteins characterised within the superfamily, and significantly these residues are all glycines, corresponding to Gly66, Gly86 and Gly201 of mammalian class I alcohol dehydrogenase. Notably, these residues are located in different domains. Hence, a distant origin and divergent functions, but related forms and interactions, appear to apply to the entire chains of the many prokaryotic and eukaryotic members. Additionally, in the zeta-crystallins/quinone oxidoreductases, a highly conserved tyrosine residue is found. This residue, in the three-dimensional structure of the homologous alcohol dehydrogenase, is positioned at the subunit cleft that contains the active site and could therefore be involved in catalysis. If so, this residue and its role may resemble the pattern of a conserved tyrosine residue in the different family of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR).},

	abstract = {A previously unreported enzymatic activity is described for monomers of the beta 1 beta 1 isoenzyme of human alcohol dehydrogenase that were prepared from dimeric enzyme by freeze-thaw in liquid nitrogen. Whereas the dimeric enzyme has optimal activity at low substrate concentrations (2.5 mM ethanol, 50 microM NAD+; "low Km" activity), the monomer has its highest activity at high substrate concentrations (1.5 M ethanol, 2.5 mM NAD+; "high Km" activity). While the activity of the monomer does not appear to be saturated at 1.5 M ethanol, its maximal activity at this high ethanol concentration exceeds the Vmax of the dimer by about 3-fold. The apparent Km of NAD+ with monomers is 270 microM, and no activity could be detected with nicotinamide mononucleotide as cofactor. During gel filtration the high Km activity elutes at a lower apparent molecular weight position than the dimer. The kinetics of monomer-to-dimer reassociation are consistent with a second-order process with a rate constant of 240 M-1 s-1. The reassociation rate is markedly enhanced by the presence of NAD+. During refolding of beta 1 beta 1 following denaturation in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, an enzyme species with high Km activity and spectral properties similar to the freeze-thaw monomer is observed, indicating that a catalytically active monomer is an intermediate in the refolding pathway. The enzymatic activity of the monomer implies that the intersubunit contacts of beta 1 beta 1 are not crucial in establishing a catalytically competent enzyme. However, the differences in specific activity and Km between monomer and dimer suggest that dimerization may serve to modulate the catalytic properties.},

This cDNA encodes an amino acid sequence representing a new class of mammalian ADH, and the deer mouse gene for this ADH is named Adh-2. ADH-negative deer mice do not produce mRNA, that is detected by the Adh-1 cDNA probe. However, both stocks of deer mice produce high levels of Adh-2 mRNA in liver. Southern analysis using an essentially full-length Adh-1 cDNA probe has shown that the Adh-1 gene is deleted in the ADH-negative mice.

ADH isozymes encoded by these genes are grouped in three distinct classes in terms of their enzymological properties. A moderate structural similarity is observed between the members of different classes. We isolated an additional member of the ADH gene family by means of cross-hybridization with the ADH2 (class I) cDNA probe. cDNA clones corresponding to this gene were derived from PCR-amplified libraries as well. The coding sequence of a 368-amino-acid-long open reading frame was interrupted by introns into eight exons and spanned approximately 17 kilobases on the genome. The gene contains a glucocorticoid response element at the 5' region. The transcript was detected in the stomach and liver. The deduced amino acid sequence of the open reading frame showed about 60\% positional identity with known human ADHs. This extent of homology is comparable to interclass similarity in the human ADH family.

A codon-substitution model was assumed, which accounts for the genetic code structure, transition/transversion bias, and base frequency biases at codon positions. Likelihood ratio tests were applied to test the constancy of nonsynonymous to synonymous rate ratios among branches (evolutionary lineages). It is found that at 22 of the 48 nuclear loci examined, the nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio varies significantly across branches of the tree. The result provides strong evidence against a strictly neutral model of molecular evolution. Our likelihood estimates of synonymous and nonsynonymous rates differ considerably from previous results obtained from approximate pairwise sequence comparisons. The differences between the methods are explored by detailed analyses of data from several genes. Transition/transversion rate bias and codon frequency biases are found to have significant effects on the estimation of synonymous and nonsynonymous rates, and approximate methods do not adequately account for those factors. The likelihood approach is preferable, even for pairwise sequence comparison, because more realistic models about the mutation and substitution processes can be incorporated in the analysis.},

The alphaalpha, beta(1)beta(1), gamma(2)gamma(2), and sigmasigma isoforms have all been found to be strongly inhibited by substituted formamides. In this paper, the structure of the alphaalpha isoform of human alcohol dehydrogenase complexed with N-cyclopentyl-N-cyclobutylformamide was determined by X-ray crystallography to 2.5 A resolution, the beta(1)beta(1) isoform of human alcohol dehydrogenase complexed with N-benzylformamide and with N-heptylformamide was determined to 1.6 and 1.65 A resolution, respectively, and the structure of the gamma(2)gamma(2) isoform complexed with N-1-methylheptylformamide was determined to 1.45 A resolution. These structures provide the first substrate-level view of the local structural differences that give rise to the individual substrate preferences shown by these highly related isoenzymes. Consistent with previous work, the carbonyl oxygen of the inhibitors interacts directly with the catalytic zinc and the hydroxyl group of Thr48 (Ser48 for gamma(2)gamma(2)) of the enzyme. The benzene ring of N-benzylformamide and the carbon chains of N-heptylformamide and N-1-methylheptylformamide interact with the sides of the hydrophobic substrate pocket whose size and shape is dictated by residue exchanges between the beta(1)beta(1) and gamma(2)gamma(2) isoenzymes. In particular, the exchange of Ser for Thr at position 48 and the exchange of Val for Leu at position 141 in the gamma(2)gamma(2) isoenzyme create an environment with stereoselectivity for the R-enantiomer of the branched N-1-methylheptylformamide inhibitor in this isoenzyme. The primary feature of the alphaalpha isoform is the Ala for Phe93 exchange that enlarges the active site near the catalytic zinc and creates the specificity for the branched N-cyclopentyl-N-cyclobutylformamide inhibitor, which shows the greatest selectivity for this unique isoenzyme of any of the formamide inhibitors.},

	abstract = {PhyML is a phylogeny software based on the maximum-likelihood principle. Early PhyML versions used a fast algorithm performing nearest neighbor interchanges to improve a reasonable starting tree topology. Since the original publication (Guindon S., Gascuel O. 2003. A simple, fast and accurate algorithm to estimate large phylogenies by maximum likelihood. Syst. Biol. 52:696-704), PhyML has been widely used ({\textgreater}2500 citations in ISI Web of Science) because of its simplicity and a fair compromise between accuracy and speed. In the meantime, research around PhyML has continued, and this article describes the new algorithms and methods implemented in the program. First, we introduce a new algorithm to search the tree space with user-defined intensity using subtree pruning and regrafting topological moves. The parsimony criterion is used here to filter out the least promising topology modifications with respect to the likelihood function. The analysis of a large collection of real nucleotide and amino acid data sets of various sizes demonstrates the good performance of this method. Second, we describe a new test to assess the support of the data for internal branches of a phylogeny. This approach extends the recently proposed approximate likelihood-ratio test and relies on a nonparametric, Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like procedure. A detailed analysis of real alignments sheds light on the links between this new approach and the more classical nonparametric bootstrap method. Overall, our tests show that the last version (3.0) of PhyML is fast, accurate, stable, and ready to use. A Web server and binary files are available from http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/.},

The approach is based on the conventional dynamic-programming method of pairwise alignment. Initially, a hierarchical clustering of the sequences is performed using the matrix of the pairwise alignment scores. The closest sequences are aligned creating groups of aligned sequences. Then close groups are aligned until all sequences are aligned in one group. The pairwise alignments included in the multiple alignment form a new matrix that is used to produce a hierarchical clustering. If it is different from the first one, iteration of the process can be performed. The method is illustrated by an example: a global alignment of 39 sequences of cytochrome c.},

	abstract = {Human glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase plays an important role in the metabolism of glutathione adducts such as S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione and S-nitrosoglutathione. The role of specific active site residues in binding these physiologically important substrates and the structural changes during the catalytic cycle of glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase was examined by determining the crystal structure of a ternary complex with S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione and the reduced coenzyme to 2.6 Å resolution. The formation of the ternary complex caused the movement of the catalytic domain toward the coenzyme-binding domain. This represents the first observation of domain closure in glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase in response to substrate binding. A water molecule adjacent to the 2?-ribose hydroxyl of NADH suggests that the alcohol proton is relayed to solvent directly from the coenzyme, rather than through the action of the terminal histidine residue as observed in the proton relay system for class I alcohol dehydrogenases. S-(Hydroxymethyl)glutathione is directly coordinated to the active site zinc and forms interactions with the highly conserved residues Arg114, Asp55, Glu57, and Thr46. The active site zinc has a tetrahedral coordination environment with Cys44, His66, and Cys173 as the three protein ligands in addition to S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione. This is in contrast to zinc coordination in the binary coenzyme complex where all of the ligands were contributed by the enzyme and included Glu67 as the fourth protein ligand. This change in zinc coordination is accomplished by an ?2.3 Å movement of the catalytic zinc.},

In this paper, we describe a new program called Clustal Omega, which can align virtually any number of protein sequences quickly and that delivers accurate alignments. The accuracy of the package on smaller test cases is similar to that of the high‐quality aligners. On larger data sets, Clustal Omega outperforms other packages in terms of execution time and quality. Clustal Omega also has powerful features for adding sequences to and exploiting information in existing alignments, making use of the vast amount of precomputed information in public databases like Pfam.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bacterial 3 alpha,20 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase reversibly oxidizes the 3 alpha and 20 beta hydroxyl groups of steroids derived from androstanes and pregnanes. It was the first short-chain dehydrogenase to be studied by X-ray crystallography. The previous description of the structure of this enzyme, at 2.6 A resolution, did not permit unambiguous assignment of several important groups. We have further refined the structure of the complex of the enzyme with its cofactor, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), and solvent molecules, at the same resolution.
RESULTS: The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains four monomers, each with 253 amino acid residues, 38 water molecules, and 176 cofactor atoms belonging to four NAD molecules--one for each subunit. The positioning of the cofactor molecule has been modified from our previous model and is deeper in the catalytic cavity as observed for other members of both the long-chain and short-chain dehydrogenase families. The nicotinamide-ribose end of the cofactor has several possible conformations or is dynamically disordered.
CONCLUSIONS: The catalytic site contains residues Tyr152 and Lys156. These two amino acids are strictly conserved in the short-chain dehydrogenase superfamily. Modeling studies with a cortisone molecule in the catalytic site suggest that the Tyr152, Lys156 and Ser139 side chains promote electrophilic attack on the (C20-O) carbonyl oxygen atom, thus enabling the carbon atom to accept a hydride from the reduced cofactor.},

The HepG2 FAS has a specific activity of 600 nmol of NADPH oxidized per min per mg, which is about half that of chicken liver FAS. All the partial activities of human FAS are comparable to those of other animal FASs, except for the beta-ketoacyl synthase, whose significantly lower activity is attributable to the low 4'-phosphopantetheine content of HepG2 FAS. We cloned the human brain FAS cDNA. The cDNA sequence has an open reading frame of 7512 bp that encodes 2504 amino acids (M(r), 272,516). The amino acid sequence of the human FAS has 79\% and 63\% identity, respectively, with the sequences of the rat and chicken enzymes. Northern analysis revealed that human FAS mRNA was about 9.3 kb in size and that its level varied among human tissues, with brain, lung, and liver tissues showing prominent expression. The nucleotide sequence of a segment of the HepG2 FAS cDNA (bases 2327-3964) was identical to that of the cDNA from normal human liver and brain tissues, except for a 53-bp sequence (bases 3892-3944) that does not alter the reading frame. This altered sequence is also present in HepG2 genomic DNA. The origin and significance of this sequence variance in the HepG2 FAS gene are unclear, but the variance apparently does not contribute to the lower activity of HepG2 FAS.},

However, previous software implementations of these newer probabilistic methods were slower than BLAST by about 100-fold. This hindered their utility, because computation speed is so critical with the rapidly increasing size of modern sequence databases.

Analysis of fibroblasts from affected individuals with a RTN4IP1 mutation showed loss of the altered protein, a deficit of mitochondrial respiratory complex I and IV activities, and increased susceptibility to UV light. Silencing of RTN4IP1 altered the number and morphogenesis of mouse RGC dendrites in vitro and the eye size, neuro-retinal development, and swimming behavior in zebrafish in vivo.

	abstract = {Molecular genetic studies have indicated that alcohol dehydrogenase may be involved in the synthesis of retinoic acid, a hormonal molecule regulating diverse cellular functions at the transcriptional level. Class IV alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) has been reported to be the most efficient enzyme catalyzing oxidation of retinol in human ADH family. Initial velocity, product inhibition, and dead-end inhibition experiments were performed with the recombinant human class IV ADH to elucidate kinetic mechanism with all-trans-retinol and all-trans-retinal as natural substrates. Fluorescence quenching was titrated in formation of the binary and abortive ternary enzyme complexes. The minimal mechanism deduced from steady-state kinetic and equilibrium binding studies is best described as an asymmetric rapid equilibrium random mechanism with two dead-end ternary complexes for retinol oxidation and a rapid equilibrium ordered mechanism with one dead-end ternary complex for retinal reduction, a unique mechanistic form for zinc-containing ADHs in the medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. Dissociation constants for the binary complexes as well as the productive and abortive ternary complexes determined from different experimental approaches are in reasonable agreement. Kinetic isotope effect studies suggest rate-limiting isomerization of the central ternary complexes in both reaction directions. The potential interference of retinol metabolism by ethanol through the ADH pathway may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of fetal alcohol syndrome and alcohol-related upper digestive tract cancer.},

	abstract = {Highly accurate estimation of phylogenetic trees for large data sets is difficult, in part because multiple sequence alignments must be accurate for phylogeny estimation methods to be accurate. Coestimation of alignments and trees has been attempted but currently only SATé estimates reasonably accurate trees and alignments for large data sets in practical time frames (Liu K., Raghavan S., Nelesen S., Linder C.R., Warnow T. 2009b. Rapid and accurate large-scale coestimation of sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees. Science. 324:1561-1564). Here, we present a modification to the original SATé algorithm that improves upon SATé (which we now call SATé-I) in terms of speed and of phylogenetic and alignment accuracy. SATé-II uses a different divide-and-conquer strategy than SATé-I and so produces smaller more closely related subsets than SATé-I; as a result, SATé-II produces more accurate alignments and trees, can analyze larger data sets, and runs more efficiently than SATé-I. Generally, SATé is a metamethod that takes an existing multiple sequence alignment method as an input parameter and boosts the quality of that alignment method. SATé-II-boosted alignment methods are significantly more accurate than their unboosted versions, and trees based upon these improved alignments are more accurate than trees based upon the original alignments. Because SATé-I used maximum likelihood (ML) methods that treat gaps as missing data to estimate trees and because we found a correlation between the quality of tree/alignment pairs and ML scores, we explored the degree to which SATé's performance depends on using ML with gaps treated as missing data to determine the best tree/alignment pair. We present two lines of evidence that using ML with gaps treated as missing data to optimize the alignment and tree produces very poor results. First, we show that the optimization problem where a set of unaligned DNA sequences is given and the output is the tree and alignment of those sequences that maximize likelihood under the Jukes-Cantor model is uninformative in the worst possible sense. For all inputs, all trees optimize the likelihood score. Second, we show that a greedy heuristic that uses GTR+Gamma ML to optimize the alignment and the tree can produce very poor alignments and trees. Therefore, the excellent performance of SATé-II and SATé-I is not because ML is used as an optimization criterion for choosing the best tree/alignment pair but rather due to the particular divide-and-conquer realignment techniques employed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The alignment of multiple protein sequences is a fundamental step in the analysis of biological data. It has traditionally been applied to analyzing protein families for conserved motifs, phylogeny, structural properties, and to improve sensitivity in homology searching. The availability of complete genome sequences has increased the demands on multiple sequence alignment (MSA) programs. Current MSA methods suffer from being either too inaccurate or too computationally expensive to be applied effectively in large-scale comparative genomics.
RESULTS: We developed Kalign, a method employing the Wu-Manber string-matching algorithm, to improve both the accuracy and speed of multiple sequence alignment. We compared the speed and accuracy of Kalign to other popular methods using Balibase, Prefab, and a new large test set. Kalign was as accurate as the best other methods on small alignments, but significantly more accurate when aligning large and distantly related sets of sequences. In our comparisons, Kalign was about 10 times faster than ClustalW and, depending on the alignment size, up to 50 times faster than popular iterative methods.
CONCLUSION: Kalign is a fast and robust alignment method. It is especially well suited for the increasingly important task of aligning large numbers of sequences.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Dead enzymes are gene products (proteins) that lack key residues required for catalytic activity. In the pre-genome era, dead enzymes were thought to occur only rarely. However, they now have been shown to represent upwards of 10\% of the total enzyme population in many families. The aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) gene family encodes proteins that, depending on the isozyme, may be either catalytically-active or -inactive. Importantly, several ALDHs exhibit biological activities independent of their catalytic activity. For many of these, the physiological and pathophysiological functions remain to be established.Areas covered: This article reviews the non-enzymatic functions of the ALDH superfamily. In addition, a search for additional non-catalytic ALDH records is undertaken. Our computational analyses reveal that there are currently 182 protein records (divided into 19 groups) that meet the criteria for dead enzymes.Expert Opinion: Dead enzymes have the potential to exert biological actions through protein-protein interaction and allosteric modulation of the activity of an active enzyme. In addition, a dead enzyme may also influence availability of substrate for other active enzymes by sequestering substrate, and/or anchoring the substrate to a particular subcellular space. A large number of putatively non-catalytic ALDH proteins exist that warrant further study.},

Comparisons based on peptides from segments of sorbitol dehydrogenase reveal that homologous regions with 38\% identity include two ligands to the active site zinc atom in liver alcohol dehydrogenase, as well as further important residues. Similarities in in other regions are less extensive, exactly as they are between different alcohol dehydrogenases. In all aspects, sorbitol dehydrogenase appears as a typical member of the alcohol dehydrogenase family. On the other hand, alcohol dehydrogenase from Drosophila, which has a shorter subunit, is not closely related to either of these enzymes, except for a region that probably corresponds to the first part of the coenzyme binding domain in many dehydrogenases. Instead, Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase in its supposed catalytic region shows similarities toward Klebsiella ribitol dehydrogenase, which also has a small subunit. It may be concluded that both alcohol and polyol dehydrogenases show two types of protein subunit, reflecting an early subdivision of polypeptide types into "long" and "short" subunits rather than into different enzymatic specificities or quaternary structures.

This conformational diversity has a significant impact on their physicochemical and biological properties. Among these are their structural stability, the transport of ions through the M2 channel, drug resistance, macromolecular docking, binding energy, and rational epitope design. To assess these properties and to calculate the associated thermodynamical observables, the conformational space must be efficiently sampled and the dynamic of the constituent atoms must be simulated. This paper presents algorithms and techniques that address the abovementioned issues. To this end, a computational review of molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo simulations, Langevin dynamics, and free energy calculation is presented. The exposition is made from first principles to promote a better understanding of the potentialities, limitations, applications, and interrelations of these computational methods.},
